    "Welcome to the second exercise! In this exercise, you will build a more complex AI agent: a **Shopping Assistant** for a clothing store.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective:\n",
    "The goal of this exercise is to create an AI agent that can:\n",
    "1. Help customers find products by retrieving product information (e.g., \"red t-shirt\", \"black shoes\").\n",
    "2. Calculate totals and discounts for selected items using a calculator tool (since agents aren’t always reliable at math)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Exercise?\n",
    "This exercise will demonstrate how to:\n",
    "1. **Coordinate Multiple Tools**: Learn how an agent can use more than one tool in a single session, switching between tools as needed to perform its tasks.\n",
    "2. **Handle Complex Workflows**: Teach the agent to handle multi-step processes (e.g., retrieving product details, calculating prices, and applying discounts).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You’ll Build:\n",
    "The Shopping Assistant AI agent will:\n",
    "1. Take user questions like:\n",
    "   - *“Can you show me the price of a blue jacket?”*\n",
    "   - *“How much would two pairs of black shoes cost?”*\n",
    "2. Retrieve product details using a product information tool.\n",
    "3. Use a calculator tool to compute totals and apply discounts.\n",
    "4. Provide meaningful responses to the user by combining outputs from multiple tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this exercise, you’ll have hands-on experience creating a multi-tool agent capable of performing more **complex operations** and reasoning about customer requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ready to Get Started?\n",
    "Let’s begin by setting up the environment and preparing the tools for our smarter, multi-functional agent!"

    "- **System Prompt**: Adjust the wording to clarify the agent’s purpose, add reasoning steps, or inject personality.\n",
    "- **Tool Definition**: Rename tools, change their parameters, or improve their descriptions for clarity and better integration.\n",
    "- **Model Settings**: Experiment with model temperature to balance determinism (`temperature=0`) and creativity (higher values).\n",
    "- **Tool Limitations**: For example, add error handling if an invalid timezone is passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tips for Effective Refinement:\n",
    "- If your agent isn’t responding as expected, start by reviewing the reasoning trace.\n",
    "- Test with a wider variety of queries to account for edge cases.\n",
    "- Iterate gradually, making small adjustments to prompts, tools, or configurations one step at a time.\n",
