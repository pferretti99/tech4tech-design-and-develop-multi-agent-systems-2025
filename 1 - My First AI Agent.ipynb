    "### Prompt Engineering Techniques:\n",
    "Here are some techniques to keep in mind when defining the agent's system prompt:\n",
    "1. **Role Prompting**: Clearly define the role of the agent (e.g., \"You are D&T Bot, an agent specialized in providing the current date and time for different locations.\").\n",
    "2. [**Few-Shot Prompting**](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/fewshot) (Optional): Provide a few examples of user questions and the appropriate responses to guide the agent further.\n",

    "You can learn more about prompt engineering in the prompting engineering guide: [https://www.promptingguide.ai/](https://www.promptingguide.ai/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Task:\n",
    "Define a system prompt for your agent. The agent should:\n",
    "- Clearly convey its **role and purpose**.\n",
    "- Provide the **current date and time** for a specific location when asked.\n",
    "- Ask the user to specify a location if it is not provided.\n",
    "- Politely decline to answer any queries unrelated to date and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Things to Consider:\n",
    "- **No Need to Describe Tools**: You do not need to specify the tools or their behaviors in the system prompt. The agent will already know how to use them based on the descriptions you provided earlier.\n",
    "- **Be Creative**: You can inject some personality into your prompt if desired to give your agent a unique tone (e.g., friendly, formal, or professional)."

    "- **System Prompt**: Adjust the wording to clarify the agent’s purpose, add reasoning steps, or inject personality.\n",
    "- **Tool Definition**: Rename tools, change their parameters, or improve their descriptions for clarity and better integration.\n",
    "- **Model Settings**: Experiment with model temperature to balance determinism (`temperature=0`) and creativity (higher values).\n",
    "- **Tool Limitations**: For example, add error handling if an invalid timezone is passed.\n",

    "\n",
    "Well done! You've successfully built your first AI agent using **LangGraph** and explored its capabilities step by step. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What We’ve Accomplished:\n",
    "1. **Understanding Stateless Assistants**: You saw how an LLM alone cannot provide real-time information without tools or resources.\n",
    "2. **Defining Tools**: You created a custom tool to retrieve the current date and time for specific time zones using Python and LangGraph's `@tool` decorator.\n",
    "3. **Crafting a System Prompt**: Using prompt engineering, you wrote clear instructions for the agent to guide its reasoning and behavior.\n",
    "4. **Building the Agent**: Using `create_react_agent`, you orchestrated the `LLM`, tools, and system prompt into a fully functional ReAct AI agent.\n",
    "5. **Testing and Refining**: You tested the agent with sample queries, refined its behavior with explicit reasoning, and enabled multi-turn conversations by incorporating **memory**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What’s Next?\n",
    "\n",
    "You’re now ready to move to the **next notebook**! In the second exercise, you’ll deepen your understanding of LangGraph by:\n",
    "- Exploring more advanced tools and functionalities.\n",
    "- Building a more complex agent with additional reasoning and decision-making capabilities.\n",
